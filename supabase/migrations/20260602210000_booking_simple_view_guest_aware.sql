-- Rebuild booking_simple to include guest bookings.
--
-- The original view (added via Supabase dashboard) inner-joined profiles on
-- bookings.user_id, so every guest booking (user_id IS NULL) silently
-- vanished from:
--   * CalendarScreen for shop owners (uses getShopBookings)
--   * CalendarScreen for clients (uses getClientBookings) — guests never had
--     a user-side calendar anyway, this just means no regression there
--   * any other surface that reads booking_simple
--
-- LEFT JOIN profiles + COALESCE to bookings.guest_name / guest_phone keeps
-- the same column shape callers expect (client_display_name, client_username,
-- client_avatar_url) while surfacing guests as first-class rows.

-- DROP first because CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW cannot remove or reorder
-- columns, and the dashboard-edited shape may differ from ours.
